## Overview

Amazon Spark Review Analysis is a project that leverages Apache Spark and its inbuilt MLlib library to analyze and derive insights from Amazon product reviews. This project utilizes the inbuilt logistic regression algorithm for sentiment analysis and the k-means clustering algorithm to identify patterns within the reviews. The combination of these algorithms, provided by Spark MLlib, offers a comprehensive understanding of the sentiments expressed in the reviews and groups them based on similarities.
